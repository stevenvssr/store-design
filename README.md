· A responsive page for a sample Product Lister Page of eight products.
· Four product blocks per row on desktop, two on mobile. Other sizes are up to you.
· You can use placeholder images for the products (https://picsum.photos is quite useful)
· As the attached files are images only and not design files, you don't have to worry about fonts, colors, and sizes being precise, but as close as possible.
· Components on the left should be collapsible. The options in them won’t be functional.
· The Sorteren op select box on the top right should have two options: Regular and Reverse.
It’s Regular by default and there are no specific rules for it (only depends on how you place them, as long as it’s consistent). And Reverse should show the eight products in the reversed order. Please note that selecting Regular should always show the initial order.
· No strict technology requirements, whatever you’re comfortable with.
